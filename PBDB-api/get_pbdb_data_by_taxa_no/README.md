- The Python script we use is `script/get_pbdb_data_by_taxa_no.py`
- Data files is in `data/`, including the taxa list you provide as well as a full PBDB dump
- Output will be put into directory `output/`

The structure above keeps the development clean and safe.

To run, open `script/get_pbdb_data_by_taxa_no.py`, set the `taxa_list_path` at the beginning, that is for the taxa list.
Also change the name/path of the output file at the end of the python script in the output part.
