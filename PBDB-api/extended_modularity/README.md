Calculate node-based extensions of modularity for a network with overlapping communities, using equation (16) in [Extension of Modularity Density for Overlapping
Community Structure](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~szymansk/papers/snaa-2014.pdf)

Standardized input data should be in `.xlsx` format and contain 2 sheets namely "`edge_list`" and "`community_list`". See `data/sample.xlsx` for a detailed example.
